          <h1>DMCA Copyright Policy</h1>
          <p><strong>Last Updated: January 15, 2025</strong></p>
          
          <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Markdown Viewer respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same. In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"), we will respond promptly to claims of copyright infringement committed using our website and services.</p>
            
            <p>This DMCA Policy outlines the procedures for reporting copyright infringement and our process for responding to such claims. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement and is accessible through our Service, please follow the procedures outlined below.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Important Notice About Our Service</h2>
            <p>Before filing a DMCA notice, please understand how Markdown Viewer operates:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Client-Side Processing:</strong> All markdown content processed through Markdown Viewer is rendered entirely in the user's web browser using client-side JavaScript. We do not host, store, or have access to user content.</li>
              
              <li><strong>No Content Storage:</strong> When users upload files or paste text into Markdown Viewer, that content remains on their device and is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
              
              <li><strong>URL Fetching:</strong> When users provide a URL to fetch markdown content, the content is retrieved directly by the user's browser from the source URL. We do not cache or store this content.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Limited Scope:</strong> Because we do not host user content, DMCA notices regarding content processed through our Service should typically be directed to the actual host of the infringing material (e.g., the website hosting the markdown file).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>However, if you believe that content on our own website (such as our documentation, blog posts, or other materials we have created) infringes your copyright, please follow the procedures below.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement</h2>
